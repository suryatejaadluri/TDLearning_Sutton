# Project 1 - Random Walk 

The purpose of this report is to replicate and analyze the experiments conducted by Richard S. Sutton in the paper titled 
'Learning to Predict by the Methods of Temporal Differences' (1988)
The paper introduces a class of learning methods for prediction problems named temporal-difference (TD) methods.

### Required libraries
Python
Matlplotlib
Numpy

### To run the project 

Create a python environment and make sure to install Numpy, and Matplotlib.
