# Project 2 - Lunar Lander

This project contains the Reinforcement learning agent, that successfully lands the lunar lander in the Open AI Gym. Lunar Environment has continuous state space with an 8-dimensional tuple representing each state space, and it has a discrete action space of 4 possible actions. The environment is implemented in the Open AI Gym.
